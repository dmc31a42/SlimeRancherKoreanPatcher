 목장 교환소는 그들이 원하는 것과 필요한 것들: 슬라임, 보석, 음식- 등등 을 교환하려고하는 너와 같은 목장주들 간의 네트워크야. 너가 해야하는것은 오직 목장 교환소 기계를 매일 확인하고 정오까지 거래를 완료하기만 하면 돼.\n\n\

m.journal.jo_moss_love,"Have you ever been in love, Beatrix? Makes you feel all achy inside, like a day after your soul's been to the gym. That's the best way I can describe it, anyway.\n\n\
It also realigns your thinking to something you swear is downright alien. All those things you thought really mattered suddenly don't. Changes you entirely!\n\n\
Can't recommend it enough.\n\n\
- H",,
m.journal.jo_moss_danger,"I highly advise you have a jetpack and a few upgrades before tackling what's ahead. The land is all broken and twisted and there's plenty of feral slimes about who you won't see coming before they blast you right into the sea.\n\n\
Keep those peepers peeled!\n\n\

m.journal.jo_quarry_springs,"I used to come here when I needed a good soak. It's a great way to clear your head.\n\n\
Sometimes I'd catch a puddle slime blushing and I could never tell if it was because I was in my bathing suit or not.\n\n\
- H",,
m.journal.jo_quarry_crystals,"I once came here to collect crystals for a little project of mine. Was trapped here for nearly two days when those curious crystal slimes came rolling my way and started firing off those dangerous shards. I thought I was gonna kick the bucket!\n\n\
The crystals were for a wind chime. I bet Thora still has it hanging from her porch.\n\n\
Worth it.\n\n\
- H",,
m.journal.jo_quarry_stars,"It was here that I knew I had to leave once again. I had spent the entire day exploring, trying to find my way to this island. And though I spent the rest of the night walking along the shore in the soft glow of these fireflowers, I caught myself looking up again and again.\n\n\
Once more, I was looking to the stars.\n\n\
- H",,
m.journal.jo_quarry_alone,"I was always happiest when I was by my lonesome. Places like this old quarry really suited me: nice and quiet and mostly empty. So I figured that life on the Far, Far Range would suit me just as well.\n\n\
And well wouldn't you just know it? I come all this way and the first person I see... well, she changed how I saw things I guess. Quiet wasn't good anymore. I liked her laugh.\n\n\

m.journal.jo_ruins_lemons,"The ghostly phase lemon trees that you may have seen were a real head scratcher to me for the longest time. I kept dreaming about an ice-cold glass of lemonade on the long summer days I spent exploring these ruins. Delicious stuff!\n\n\
But here's the trick: if you want those lemons, you've got to be willing to part with a fruit of your own. Give it a shot.\n\n\
- H",,
m.journal.jo_ruins_intro,"Fascinating aren't they? Who do you think constructed these ancient ruins, and for what purpose? I'd visit this place and ponder that question often. Only one thing is for certain: these folks liked slimes!\n\n\
Eventually I came to realize what this place was for and how to utilize it.\n\n\
Will you do the same?\n\n\
- H",,
m.journal.jo_ruins_doors,"These strange, glass doors are a good reminder that you can't always have both. Hit that switch over there all you like and both doors will never be open.\n\n\
Sometimes you gotta choose one path or another and there's no way around it. But you know what? Either path you choose is gonna make you hurt some for want of walking the other.\n\n\
Life is filled with doors like these.\n\n\
- H",,
m.journal.jo_ruins_sanctum,"The ruins used to be some kind of warp station, used by whoever created it to connect to one of the most distant corners of the Far, Far Range. Be careful, Beatrix: once you cross over you'll be in truly untamed country. Though beautiful, the other side can be an unforgiving place.\n\n\
- H",,
m.journal.jo_desert_firestorm,"The Glass Desert is a fascinating place but you need to be on guard: at any moment a dangerous solar anomaly can occur that will cause all heck to break loose for a spell.\n\n\
You'll know it when you see it, and when you do, head for cover or risk burning your tuchus!\n\n\
- H",,
m.journal.jo_desert_fountain,"The desert is a harsh place for sure, but there are little pockets like this where life is waiting to flow back into the soil, and reach toward the clouds.\n\n\
Of course, it might happen a little faster if you give it a helping hand. Use that noggin, Beatrix!\n\n\
- H",,
m.journal.jo_desert_glass,"Must have been one heck of a scorcher that caused these glass formations. They always looked like flames to me, like a great firestorm covered this land before being frozen in time.\n\n\
Then again, maybe these are flames burning away but at a pace we can't even perceive. Perhaps this desert has two different times overlapping one another and here we are stuck in the middle of it.\n\n\
Wouldn't that just be wild?\n\n\
- H",,
m.journal.jo_desert_overlook,"Quite a sight to gaze upon the sand sea out there, no? I've scoured every corner of the desert and everywhere I look, that sand sea stretches to the horizon. Makes you wonder just where the heck on the Far, Far Range you are when the Slime Sea is nowhere to be found!\n\n\
